# Python course

In the folder **Answers** there is python code for the exercises in https://peatutor.com/python/Exercises/

In the exercise 3A in used file names like person1.py where the number 1 means that this file is used in question 1. I used that system because the class Person is needed in several questions and they need different properties.
