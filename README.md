# Python course

In the folder **Answers** there is python code for the exercises in https://peatutor.com/python/Exercises/

## Exercise 3A

In this exercises I created a separate file for every class, because it is a common way to work. So example class Person is intriduced in file person.py

In the exercise **3A** in used file names like person1.py where the number 1 means that this file is used in question 1. I used that system because the class Person is needed in several questions and they need different properties.

## Exercise 3B

In this exercise I made the code simplier by writing the whole code allways in one file. Also I have used AI to generate the answers in this section, but I have to edit the code a little bit because there was some errors.
